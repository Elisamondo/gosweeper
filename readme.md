# GOSWEEPER - a CLI minesweeping adventure

## Advisory Notice -

To me, this is a hobby project for learning Go, to your anti-virus, this is an unknown executable that sorta looks like a virus.

Unless you know me you probably shouldn't run this (duh),
but if you do you should:

- manually verify that the existing go files are not shady
- install GO
- Clone the repo
- Delete existing executables **WITHOUT** running them
- for mac ``` go build -o gosweeper ```
- for windows - ```GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o  gosweeperWindows64```

If you are:

- less technically minded
- know me personally
- live life on the edge

Do the following instead:

- download either gosweeper (for mac) or gosweeperWindows64 (for Windows)
- ensure your antivirus ignores the executable
- run executable on the command line with (Mac)```./gosweeper``` or (Windows) ```.\gosweeperWindows64```
